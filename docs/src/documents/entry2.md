# Go-App

Go-App is a framework for managing web pages in Go including fully static pages

## Basics

As explained in https://go-app.dev a static web page can be created as easily as a single component:

````
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/maxence-charriere/go-app/v10/pkg/app"
)

// hello is a component that displays a simple "Hello World!". A component is a
// customizable, independent, and reusable UI element. It is created by
// embedding app.Compo into a struct.
type hello struct {
	app.Compo
}

// The Render method is where the component appearance is defined. Here, a
// "Hello World!" is displayed as a heading.
func (h *hello) Render() app.UI {
	return app.H1().Text("Hello World!")
}

func main() {
	// The first thing to do is to associate the hello component with a path.
	//
	// This is done by calling the Route() function,  which tells go-app what
	// component to display for a given path, on both client and server-side.
	app.Route("/", func() app.Composer { return &hello{} })

	// Once the routes set up, the next thing to do is to either launch the app
	// or the server that serves the app.
	//
	// When executed on the client-side, the RunWhenOnBrowser() function
	// launches the app,  starting a loop that listens for app events and
	// executes client instructions. Since it is a blocking call, the code below
	// it will never be executed.
	//
	// When executed on the server-side, RunWhenOnBrowser() does nothing, which
	// lets room for server implementation without the need for precompiling
	// instructions.
	app.RunWhenOnBrowser()
}
```

There is a more standard method to then turn this into a static page but here I am just embedding

the wasm_exec.js file in my html and then using the compiled web assembly file directly.
