## About Me

I am a data scientist (by training), data software engineer/DBA (by trade) and roboticist (by night), with expertise in machine learning algorithms, analytics and cutting edge data science tools like SQL, Hadoop, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn and AWS, as well as 10+ years of experience with C++ and Python and database engineering including use of AWS, Azure and GCP cloud infrastructure.
I got my PhD in 2012 at the University of Rochester. As a PhD student and then as a postdoctoral researcher in physics I developed my computational and analytical skills including machine learning tools like logistic regression and random forests and feature extraction using correlation, principle component analysis and linear discriminant analysis.
In June of 2016 I became an Insight Data Science fellow. As a fellow I developed a user friendly web application, NerdVentures!, and created strong relationships with mentors in a network of over 400 employed data scientists at places like Facebook, LinkedIn and Netflix. Have worked at large startups like Uber, Zymergen and Digital Diagnostics and currently employed as a Senior Cloud Database Engineer at The RealReal. I am also passionate about libraries and am pursuing my MSLIS at Syracuse University with a goal of democratizing data access
