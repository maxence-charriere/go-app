// Composer defines a contract for creating custom, independent, and reusable
// UI elements. Components that satisfy the Composer interface serve as building
// blocks for richer user interfaces in a structured manner.
//
// Implementing the Composer interface typically involves embedding app.Compo
// into a struct and defining the Render method, which dictates the component's
// visual representation.
//
// Example:
//
//	type Hello struct {
//	    app.Compo
//	}
//
//	func (c *Hello) Render() app.UI {
//	    return app.Text("hello")
//	}

// Mounter represents components that require initialization or setup actions
// when they are integrated into the DOM. By implementing the Mounter interface,
// components gain the ability to define specific behaviors that occur right
// before they are visually rendered or reintegrated into the DOM hierarchy.
type Mounter interface {
	// OnMount is triggered just before the component is embedded into the DOM.
	// Use this hook to perform any pre-render configurations or
	// initializations.
	// This method operates within the UI goroutine.

// Dismounter outlines the behavior for components that require specific
// tasks or cleanup operations when they're detached from the DOM. Components
// adhering to this interface can designate procedures to run immediately
// after their removal from the DOM structure.
type Dismounter interface {
	// OnDismount is invoked immediately after the component is detached from
	// the DOM. This method offers a stage for executing cleanup or other
	// concluding operations.
	// This function is executed within the UI goroutine.

// Navigator characterizes components that need to perform specific

// to be executed when they are navigated to within the application.

// Updater encapsulates components that require specific behaviors or reactions
// when one of their exported fields is updated by the closest parent component.
// Implementing the Updater interface allows components to define responsive
// actions that should be executed whenever they are modified by a parent.
type Updater interface {
	// OnUpdate is triggered whenever an exported field of the component gets
	// modified by its immediate parent component. This method is an opportunity
	// to handle related reactions or recalculations.

	// OnAppUpdate is called once a new version of the application has been

	// app version.
	// This function always operates within the UI goroutine context.

// AppInstaller outlines components that receive notifications about changes in
// the application's installation status. Through this interface, components can
// actively respond to installation state transitions, facilitating dynamic
// user experiences tailored to the app's current status.
type AppInstaller interface {
	// OnAppInstallChange is invoked when the application shifts between the
	// states of being installable and actually installed.
	//
	// To determine the current installation state, one can use
	// Context.IsAppInstallable() or Context.IsAppInstalled().
	//
	// By leveraging this method, components can maintain alignment with the
	// app's installation status, potentially influencing UI elements like an
	// "Install" button visibility or behavior.
	// This method is always executed in the UI goroutine context.

// Resizer identifies components that respond to size alterations within the
// application. These components can dynamically adjust to diverse size
// scenarios, ensuring they maintain both a visually appealing and functional
// display.
type Resizer interface {
	// OnResize is called whenever the application experiences a change in size.
	// Components can use this method to make appropriate adjustments,
	// recalculations, or layout shifts in response to the modified dimensions.
	// Note: This method operates exclusively within the UI goroutine context.
